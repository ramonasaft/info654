<p>In her 1980 essay “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,” the Jewish lesbian poet Adrienne Rich writes that “Lesbian existence suggests both the fact of the historical presence of lesbians and our continuing creation of the meaning of that existence” (Blood, Bread and Poetry, 51). Following her definition of lesbian existence, Rich proposes a theory of the lesbian continuum, a constant oscillation, moving between the historical, literary, and living. Crucial to Rich’s theorizing is the necessity of a backwards construction of lesbian history.
     As she writes, “lesbian existence has been lived (unlike, say, Jewish or Catholic existence) without access to any knowledge of a tradition, a continuity, a social underpinning” (52). Rich’s literature creates a movement away from just the lived to the written, from history experienced to history recognized and archived. Her writing exemplifies the embodied location of the lesbian as one that transcends stagnant models of time.
</p>
<p>   In the early days of Rich’s literary career, she translated the work of poet Kadya Molodowsky from Yiddish into English. Rich and Molodowsky existed, for the most part, on different planes, both generationally and linguistically. But, for a moment, those differentiated locations in place and time collapsed. In Queer Expectations: A Genealogy of Jewish Women’s Poetry, Zohar Weiman-Kelman writes of the interconnection of the two poets. Weiman-Kelman unveils an image of Rich and Molodowsky seated next to each other at the publication of Rich’s translation of Molodowsky’s poetry. The image rests on the page, depicting what Weiman-Kelman calls “the intergenerational dream encounter” present in both poets' 
work (Weiman-Kelman, 21). Weiman-Kelman goes on to pose a question in relation to this image capturing a fleeting moment of poetic continuity; “how might we imagine a historical model that builds at once on historicity and contemporaneity, on blood and text, a narrative that refuses to be
trapped in or relegated outside of tradition but rather generates new modes of continuity through the very breaks with and in history” (Weiman-Kelman, 22). It is from this vantage point, of the lesbian continuum and the coexistence of blood and text, that I read The Book of Ruth.
</p>
<p>The Book of Ruth is read annually in the Jewish month of Sivan, conjuring a thousands of years long textual tradition of interpretation. A brief summary and some context may be helpful prior to my theorizing of this text. The text of Ruth is found in Kethuvim (Writings) and is one of the five Megillot (scrolls). Because it is not in the Five Books of Moses, Ruth falls outside of the weekly Torah reading cycle and is instead read on the holiday of Shavuot, The Festival of Weeks. The reading of this specific text on this holiday has a significance to the construction and passing of time that I will explore in more detail later on. As is the case with most texts in the Tanakh, the exact date that Ruth was written is impossible to identify; however, “Many scholars propose a date between 950 and 700 BCE, that is, between the time of David and the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Others suggest a date during the period of the Babylonian exile or in the early period of the return (586-500 BCE). (Jewish Study Bible, 1579).2 Within either of these proposed time frames, there is an unsteady, yet necessary, relationship to time. The Jewish year is centered around the passing of time as it relates to the agricultural cycle of the Levant. Holidays come and go along with the seasons, and the four new year celebrations are intertwined with the harvests. The harvests are obviously annual, but cannot be expected on the exact same day every year and often vary based on changing environmental factors that are not entirely reliable.</p>
<p>The exposition of this story is linked to that of the partially unpredictable nature of the harvest: “In the days when the chieftains ruled, there was a famine in the land; and a man of Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the country of Moab” (Ruth 1:1). In many ways, if it weren't for the disruption in the cycle of the harvest, the central characters, Ruth and Naomi, might never have met. It is through this happenstance warp of expected cycles of time that Ruth and Naomi’s relationship forms. The narrative that follows the initial problem of flawed agricultural production expands to topics far beyond just agricultural production, but remains in close relation with the harvest cycle. To escape the famine, Naomi and her sons move to Moab, the country from which Ruth hails.</p>
<p>To summarize what follows, Naomi, her husband Elimelech, and her two sons, Mahlon and Chillion, travel to the country of Moab remaining there for ten years, both sons marrying Moabite women. Mahlon marries a woman from Moab named Ruth. Elimelech dies, and Naomi’s two sons follow him in death. When pressed to leave her mother-in-law Naomi’s side, Ruth refuses and the two women stay together. Here lies the possibility that perhaps Ruth and Naomi were lesbians. Maybe after their husbands died they realized not that Naomi loved Elimelech and Ruth loved Mahlon, but they in fact loved each other. When Ruth said “‘Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried.’”(Ruth 1:16-18) she was exclaiming her romantic love and devotion for Naomi. One could absolutely read this as a story of a lesbian romance, midrashically determining it through direct examples in the text. Later on, Naomi, concerned for the prosperity and livelihood of Ruth, as well as herself, instructs Ruth to find a new husband. Naomi tells Ruth to go to the fields of a man named Boaz, a distant relative of Elimelech, and glean. After Ruth’s participation in the barley harvest, she goes to Boaz one night and proposes a
4
levirate marriage of sorts. Boaz obliges, and Ruth subsequently has a son, Obed, who will become the grandfather of King David. In the final chapter of Ruth it is written that “A son is born to Naomi!” (Ruth 4:17). Later on, I will devote more attention to this crucial line which complicates the nature of genealogy and how, through subtle choices of language and interaction, a queer narrative emerges from this text.</p>
