    <h2>Research Your Town: פאָרשט איער שטעטל </h2> 
     <p>The shtetl is a crucial archetype in Jewish history. Shtetl translates from Yiddish to ‘little town.’ This diminutive term, often used by those who had left the shtetl, describes a locale somewhere in between city and village and has been a site of much cultural debate. Post-Holocaust scholarly sensibilities often look at shtelts as a provincial cultural phenomenon. They are seen as centers of religiosity, piousness and the old ways, picturing what is depicted in Fiddler on the Roof. While the majority of those living in shtetls were Jewish, many other cultural groups resided there as well, including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Armenian people. Most shtetls were located within the Pale of Settlement, a territory existing from 1791 to 1915 in Russian territory allowing Jews to live with partial autonomy. The shtetl is often remembered as a place of poverty, agony and isolation; however, between the 1790’s and 1840’s there was what some call “The Golden Age of the Shtetl.” During this time, the shtetl was a hub of yiddishkayt and saw great growth of Jewish arts and culture.</p>
     <p>The official academic study of the shtetl only really began after the Holocaust, but more informal modes of local history record keeping began long before that. In the late 18th century, Jewish scholars followed trends of modernization and neglected to study the history of their provincial roots. Early studies in Jewish history consisted mostly of advocacy for Jewish emancipation, not so much future historical consideration. Eventually their focus shifted and the study of Jewish history in Eastern Europe became focussed on folkways and scholars began to shift their understanding of shtetls less as relics of a somber past and more as heritage sites that should be remembered. S-Anski, a pioneering Jewish folklorist was instrumental in this shift. </p>
     <p>The shtetl has consistently been a source of art and cultural criticism. This exhibit explores various artists’ reflections on shtetl life.</p>

<h2>Pinkeysim</h2>
<p>Pinkeysim are important documents in the recollection of the shtetl. Pinkeysim, community record books, were local history records written by those living in the shtetls that they depict. This particular example (courtesy of YIVO) is from Sodilkov, Ukraine and describes what this shtetl was like. Unlike Yizkor Books that were written after the Holocaust, pinkeysim were usually recorded in the timeframe they were written about. </p>

<h2>Sholem Aleichem</h2>
<p>Record keeping did not only exist in official scholarly records. Sholem Aleichem, author and playwright, was a record keeper in his own right. He is the author of ‘Tevye’s Daughters,’ ‘Some Laughter, Some Tears,’ and ‘Tevye the Dairyman’ (which was the inspiration for Fiddler on the Roof). Pictured above is a poster for 'Tevye the Dairyman' (in Yiddish, 'Tevye der Milchker'). This Polish and Yiddish poster was advertising for a performance of this show at the Krakow Jewish Theater.

    <h2>Marc Chagall</h2>
    <p>Marc Chagall was a Belarusian and French artist and painter whose work is often looked to as quintessential 20th century Jewish art. Influenced by Fauvism and Cubism, Chagall’s work depicted various aspects of Jewish life in his memorable colorful, dream-like style. The painting above, ‘I and the Village’ represents a reflection back on life in the shtetl.</p>

<h2>Mark Podwal</h2>
<p>Mark Powdwal is a more contemporary artist who creates art and Judaica that often references the life of Eastern European Jews, as that is where his ancestors are from. After the Holocaust, most evidence of Jewish life in Eastern Europe had disappeared and it became difficult to visualize a Jewish past in rural towns. In response to this, Podwal painted a mural in his mother’s birthplace, Dąbrowa Białostocka. The oak tree that Podwal painted acts as a memorial to the Jews that had for centuries been the predominant population of the town. Interspersed in the branches of the tree are the letters of the Yiddish alphabet. (Image courtesy of markpodwal.com)</p>
