        <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
        <p>We aim to create an online visual culture platform that brings iconic museum collections from major cities, like New York, into a digital “museum” experience. We aim to bridge the accessibility gap by providing curated digital exhibitions to individuals who cannot physically visit these collections or are unaware of how to access similar materials online. This website will target national and international audiences, particularly those in underserved or remote regions, offering them the opportunity to explore and learn from cities' rich cultural heritage. Each exhibit is framed with a curatorial perspective, providing educational context to enhance the audience's understanding of these works.</p>
