        <h3>Curatorial Statement</h3>
        <p> The first spiritualists were heavily influenced by telecommunication technologies of the
            mid-nineteenth century like the telegraph. The Fox Sisters first interactions with the ghost of the
            peddler were labeled as the “Rochester Rappings”. Adapting with technology, the camera could
            be viewed as a planchette, but at the same time that is not such a different concept from the spirit
            photographers of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. This exhibit evokes this connection to the past and
            enables the use of a camera as a tool of dialogue to convey the transition between life and death.
            The images in this show capture the subliminal space between these transformations,
            representing the muddled communications of mediums from the past and giving a depiction to
            the enigma of departure.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/271509">Carte-de-Visite Album of British and European Royalty</a>    
            <ul>
                <li>Carte-de-Visite Album of British and European Royalty,  Various artists/makers, ca. 1860s–70s</li>
                <li>This poignant image of Princess Alice, dressed in mourning attire following the death of her father, Queen Victoria’s consort, Prince Albert, highlights 
                    the personal and public dimensions of grief in the Victorian era. The carte-de-visite format, which allowed these intimate portraits to be widely circulated, 
                    transformed the act of mourning into a shared experience, where the private sorrow of royalty became a public spectacle. Similarly, the photograph of Louis IV, 
                    Grand Duke of Hesse, captured in the 1860s, reflects the dignified yet somber visual language of European nobility during periods of mourning.In the context of 
                    spiritualism, where individuals sought to communicate with the deceased, these images serve as a reminder of the era’s desire to memorialize those lost, creating 
                    a lasting connection between the living and the dead. Much like the mediums and spirit photographers of the time, these photographs attempt to preserve the presence 
                    of the departed, using technology to convey the absence of life. These royal portraits, framed by mourning customs, resonate with the exhibition's theme of "muddled 
                    communications." They underscore how photography, much like spiritualist practices, blurred the lines between the living and the dead—turning a moment of loss into a 
                    tangible connection with the past, both personal and public.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Alphonse Le Blondel, French, ca. 1850 </li>
                <li>This postmortem photograph by Alphonse Le Blondel captures the somber tradition of memorializing the deceased in the mid-nineteenth 
                    century. In an era where death was often photographed as part of mourning rituals, this image serves as both a personal tribute and 
                    a public acknowledgment of the fragility of life. Postmortem photography became increasingly popular during the rise of spiritualism, 
                    a movement deeply influenced by technological advancements like the telegraph and the camera. Much like the telegraph's ability to 
                    transcend space, photography was seen as a tool that could capture the essence of the departed, offering a fleeting connection to 
                    those who had passed. This photograph evokes the transitional space between life and death, where the camera serves as both witness 
                    and participant in the liminal experience. The stillness of the subject and the ethereal quality of the photograph speak to the spirit’s 
                    elusive nature, rendering a moment of transformation into an enduring image.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Frederick Hudson, ca. 1872</li>
                <li>This photograph by Frederick Hudson, a pioneer of spirit photography, captures a spectral figure appearing alongside Mr. Reeve. Spirit photographs like this were crafted using long 
                    exposures and double exposures, blending emerging photographic techniques with spiritualist practices to evoke the presence of the departed. Hudson's work reflects the technological 
                    advancements of his era, paralleling the telegraph's ability to transmit messages across distances. The camera here acts as a planchette, visually manifesting the "muddled communications" 
                    described in the curatorial statement. The faint apparition represents the liminal space between life and death, where technology and belief intertwined to navigate the mysteries of existence.
                    This image offers a striking depiction of how photography was not merely a documentary tool but a medium for visualizing the invisible, transforming the unseen into tangible proof of the 
                    spirit world..</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/302466">The Ghost in the Stereoscope</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Unknown, ca. 1852</li>
                <li>"The Ghost in the Stereoscope" exemplifies the merging of Victorian fascination with optical illusions 
                    and spiritualist practices. Created by the London Stereoscopic Company, this stereoscopic card would 
                    have been viewed through a stereoscope, producing a three-dimensional illusion of a ghostly figure. In an era 
                    captivated by both technological innovation and supernatural exploration, the stereoscope became a tool for 
                    engaging with the uncanny. Much like the telegraph connected distant voices, the stereoscope offered a portal 
                    to otherworldly realms. The ghostly apparition materialized within the frame reflects the blurred boundaries 
                    between reality and the supernatural, resonating with the exhibition’s theme of "muddled communications."
