<p>It is only recently in the timeline of biblical scholarship that expansive interpretations of the Book of Ruth have emerged. These expansive interpretations are ones that utilize queer theory to read Ruth. As is the case with many of the queer readings of biblical stories, it is challenging to come to a simple literary conclusion. Because of the nature of biblical narrative, context, and time frame in which this was written, there is little to no direct writing of queer relationships. In Narrative Desire and The Book of Ruth, Stephanie Day Powell writes, “Searching for evidence of same-sex relations and relationships in the Hebrew Bible has proved particularly difficult. While the debates regarding homosexuality and the Bible are familiar enough...suffice it to say the information that the Bible does provide is largely polemical in nature” (4). In more recent years, biblical scholarship has started to invite the possibility that perhaps the relationship between Ruth and Naomi is more than just that of in-laws and instead an example of lesbian existence within the Hebrew Bible. Scholars like Powell suggest that through queer theory and methods of reading we can find Ruth and Naomi’s relationship to be a queer one, in which instead of being in love with their respective husbands they are in love with each other. However, in my view of Ruth, an explicit story of lesbian desire is not what produces a compelling queer reading of the text. I propose instead that, through the utilization of contemporary queer reading practices, the queerness of this ancient story can emerge. It is not through an explicit story of lesbian desire existing within the Book of Ruth that a convincing queer interpretation can emerge, but rather through a contemporary reading of the text that invokes the queerness of its narrative structure.</p>
<p>Returning to Weiman-Kelman, who writes about the poetry of Yocheved Bat-Miriam, a modernist poet writing in Hebrew, we can begin to find methods of parsing out queer narratives in otherwise inexplicitly queer texts. Bat-Miriam’s poetry depicts encounters between women that, when read through a contemporary lens as Weiman-Kelman does, are understood to be queer encounters. This is to say that Bat-Miriam was not writing poetry with outright queer content, but through expansive readings it is understood as being queer. Weiman-Kelman reads this poetry as queer, with the caveat that their “reading of Bat-Miriam is not anchored in her sexual practice. Similarly [the] use of Bat-Miriam to discuss a resistance to heteronormative futurity and reproduction does not rely on her biography” (xv). This is precisely how I understand Ruth to be a queer narrative. Ruth becomes a queer narrative through one’s looking back towards it through a queer lens. Doing this requires a reader to parse the text thoughtfully and expansively enough to find seeds of queerness throughout. It requires a reader versed in current understandings of what constitutes queerness to be able to see an alternative reading that could not have been seen in past understandings of a text. Introducing a term coined by Christopher Nealon as well as written about by Powell, Weiman-Kelman explains that, “To retroactively read this desire as queer or lesbian when Bat-Miriam herself did not claim such an identity exposes my role as a queer reader, the one Nealon calls a ‘hermeneutic friend,’ who can identify (and identify with) desires that were not or could not be, intelligible to authors in the past” (Weiman-Kelman, xv). The “hermeneutic friend” allows a certain access to a text outside of original and heteronormative interpretations. The concept of the hermeneutic friend invites the readers to interact with the text in a unique way. In reading a text through this method, the line of differentiation between the reader and the text itself becomes blurry. What is often frowned upon, projecting one's own lived experience onto a text, becomes necessary in order to uncover these desires that were unintelligible to authors (and readers for that matter) of the past. This allows the reader to become the text and the text to become the reader.
</p>
<p>The concept of the hermeneutic friend is especially pertinent when reading texts in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish textual tradition causes a unique embodiment of text. As each chapter of every text is read at its respective point in the year cycle, those reading it are asked to engage in an ever evolving act of interpretation, of hermeneutics that remember a history as constantly relevant to its readers. When these texts are read, they change based on who is reading them, where, and when. Thus, everyone interacting with the Jewish textual tradition acts as a hermeneutic friend. However, what Nealon, Powell, and Weiman-Kelman are referring to is a distinctly queer reading, the “hermeneutic friend” being one who can find queer desire where it has not yet been spoken, whether or not it is written explicitly. The hermeneutic friend then creates a narrative and textual genealogy through interacting with the text in this manner.</p>
